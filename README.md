A game for the mandatory assignment

Names: Karl Martin Helset, Hannah MÃ¸rken, Jonas Holgersen

Run sequence:
We would reccommend you to run the game in this order:

1. Run server.py so the clients have something to connect to and the game can run.
2. Run two instances of client.py so they can play against eachother.
3. Run flask_webpage.py so you can se champion stats and match history on a webpage. (You can run this file whenever as it is independent from the other files.) You can find the webpage-address in the terminal.
